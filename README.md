## Introduction

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell designed especially for system administration. This repository serves as a sandbox to test, learn, and develop PowerShell scripts and modules. Feel free to explore the content, suggest improvements, or contribute your own scripts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **classes/**: Contains PowerShell class definitions used across various scripts.
- **config/**: Configuration files that support the scripts and modules.
- **data/**: Sample data files utilized by the scripts for processing and testing.
- **functions/**: Reusable PowerShell functions that can be imported and used in different scripts.
- **scripts/**: Standalone PowerShell scripts demonstrating specific tasks or solutions.
- **tests/**: Test scripts to validate the functionality of modules and functions.
- **.github/workflows/**: GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines.
